The backend is designed to support the following key operations:

2. Product Listing: It manages the comprehensive listing of products available on the website, providing details such as product title, description, price, images, categories, colors, and sizes.

3. Filtering Products: The backend allows users to filter products based on specific attributes such as color, size, and price range, helping them find their desired items more efficiently.

4. Cart Management: Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the contents of their cart, and manage the quantity of products to be purchased.

5. Order Placement: Once users have selected the desired products, they can place orders for their selected items, specifying shipping and billing addresses, and providing payment details.

6. Order Confirmation: After successfully placing an order, users can view the confirmation details of their orders, including order ID, shipping address, billing address, payment details, and the total price of the order.

The backend's primary objective is to seamlessly integrate these functionalities, ensuring the smooth and secure functioning of the e-commerce website. By handling these crucial operations, the backend streamlines the entire shopping process, providing users with an efficient and enjoyable online shopping experience.
